1. In Agile/Scrum development, describe the role of the product owner.

```
A team member whose role is to represent the interests of the customer. Essentially, they serve as a stand in 
for the customer to ensure the team can best meet the customer's needs by having someone whose role it is
to simply get into the head of the customer and then transmit that information to the rest of the team.

```

2. What are four artifacts defined by the Scrum process?

```
1. The product backlog

2. The sprint backlog

3. The increment

4. The burndown chart
```

3. In regards to user involvement, explain the difference between Agile methodologies and traditional/heavyweight methodologies.

```
In agile the entire methodology is designed around constant user interaction where project goals and 
requirementscan constantly be refined to better serve the needs of the user rather in a traditional
methodology where usersare only invloved at the beginning for requirments definition and at the end
for validation testing.
```

4. Why are very few requirements analysts entry-level engineers?

```
Few entry level engineers become requirements analysts simply because the skills required are much more common
with those who initially work on the buisness side of development as largely requirements analysts need to
simply communicate with the customer in the language of the customers industry rather than take part in
the actual coding. 

```

5. When developing object-oriented use cases, what is an _actor_?

```
An actor in an object-oriented use case is the person (or person stand in) that is using the system's
functionality tocomplete the goal(s) the software is being developed to meet.
