1. According to Fred Brooks, what are three _joys_ of programming, that is, things that make it fun?

```
1.) Creating Something

2.) Making something useful for others

3.) Constant learning due to the unique nature of each program.
```

2. If you have a team of 15 people, assuming intercommunication between all of them, how many pairwise communication channels are there on your team?  (I am looking for a specific number, not a formula)

```
105
```

3. What is Brooks's Law?

```
Brook's Law States that adding human resources to a late software project makes it later.

```

4. "The system shall be able to run on Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD systems." Is this an example of a program requirement or design constraint?  Why?

```
This is a program requirement as it requires the program to run on the three listed Operating Systems but does not
limit the program to just those 3 systems.
```

5. What are two __nontechnical__ considerations of software development and support covered by Tsui _et al_?

```
Effort Estimation/Scheduling

Task Assignment/Communication
