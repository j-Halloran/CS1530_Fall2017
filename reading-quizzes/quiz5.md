Name: `Jake Halloran` Class start time: `3 PM`

1. According to Tsui _et al_, what are the four major sets of activities in the software project management process?

```
Planning

Organizing

Monitoring

Adjusting

```

2. You are developing a system which you estimate will need 20 classes.  There will be one very simple GUI interface.  Based on previous productivity of your team, it takes 16 person-days to fully develop one class.

Using the Lorenz-Kidd OO estimation technique, estimate how long it will take (in person-days) to complete the project.  Show your work.

```
20 Classes * 2.25 Simple GUI Weight * 16 Person-Days/class = 720 Person-days

```

3. In your code, you have a very long method, `extrapolateDucksAndFish()`.  Reviewing the code, you are able to deconstruct it so that the method calls three new, shorter  methods, `initializeAnimals()`, `extrapolateDucks()`, and `extrapolateFish()`.  In the process, you are also able to remove some duplicate code, leading to an overall reduction of 35% in terms of lines of code, without changing any of the functionality.

What is the name of the process that you just did?

```
Refactoring

```

4. According to Tsui _et al_, what is the one kind of comment which should _not_ be used?

```
Comments that do nothing but repeat the code should not be used according to Tsui.

```

5. Name one instance of a trade-off in implementation characteristics (e.g. making the system/code more X makes the system less Y).

```
Generally, optimizing for performance generates much less readable and maintainable code.

```
